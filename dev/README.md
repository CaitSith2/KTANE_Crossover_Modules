# Thanks for helping me out!
This is the development version of my mod, Crossover Modules.

Specific things that need to be tested:
 - Symbolic Password module
  - Difficulty Level (too easy?)

To install:
 1. Navigate to your KTANE mods directory (usually under `C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\mods`). If the `mods` folder does not exist, create one.
 2. Extract the contents of the above zip file into the `mods` folder.
 3. Run the game via `ktane.exe` found under `C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes`.
 
 Feel free to tell me any suggestions, comments, or complaints via discord: `@ZekNikZ#0878`.
